# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis on Kickstarter data to discover trends

The most successful kickstarter campaigns in the data set were theater plays followed by rock music and documentaries.  The time of year best suited for launching successful theater campaigns would be May through July.

The most successful goal ranges in relation to outcomes would be $0-15,000 and $35,000-$45,000 although other factors likely influence the outcomes of meeting goals.

It may be more helpful to consider some statistics.  The mean goal for successful plays was $5,049 with a median of $3,000 and a standard deviation of $7,749.  So, few successful plays had a significantly higher goal than the median, pulling up the mean.  75% of successful plays had a goal of $5,000 or under with 75% of pledges being $5,699 or under.  The median pledge of the successful plays was $3,168 and a mean pledge of $5,602 which means the backers supported these plays adequately.  Failed plays goals mean was twice that of successful counterparts at $10,554 with a median pledge of $103 dollars. Therefore, high goals with low pledge rates are not a recipe for success.  The backers count mean for successful plays was 63 and 8 for failed plays, so a rate of 8.1x higher respectively, and an overall count of backers ratio of 14:1 for successful vs. failed campaigns.

So to sum up, Louise, if you're looking to launch a successful campaign for a theater play then keep your goal manageable within $5,000-$10,000 range.  Try to get as many backers as possible and request an adequate donation in proportion to your goal, above $Goal/63.
